# MAGIC %md ### README - MLflow Export/Import
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC #### Overview
# MAGIC * Export and import MLflow objects - runs, experiments or registered models.
# MAGIC * Copy MLflow objects from one workspace (tracking server) to another.
# MAGIC * Customers often need to copy MLflow objects (registered models, experiments or runs) to another workspace.
# MAGIC   * For example, we train model runs in the dev workspace, and then we wish to promote the best run to a production workspace.
# MAGIC   * There is no official and easy way to do this.
# MAGIC   * Customer experiment data is currently locked into a workspace and not portable.
# MAGIC * These notebooks are an unofficial tool that address these problems.
# MAGIC * You will need to set up a common cloud bucket mounted on DBFS in your source and destination workspaces.
# MAGIC * For details see:

# MAGIC #### Setup
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC There are two different ways to install the package.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ##### Install package in notebook
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC This is the default executed in the [Common]($./Common) notebook.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC [Install notebook-scoped libraries with %pip](https://docs.databricks.com/libraries/notebooks-python-libraries.html#install-notebook-scoped-libraries-with-pip).
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ```
# MAGIC pip install git+https:///github.com/amesar/mlflow-export-import/#egg=mlflow-export-import
# MAGIC ```
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ##### Install package as a wheel on cluster 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Build the wheel artifact on your laptop, upload it to DBFS and then [install it on your cluster](https://docs.databricks.com/libraries/cluster-libraries.html).
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ```
# MAGIC python setup.py bdist_wheel
# MAGIC databricks fs cp dist/mlflow_export_import-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl {MY_DBFS_PATH}
# MAGIC ```
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Note, on the demo shard the wheel can be found at: `dbfs:/home/andre.mesarovic@databricks.com/lib/wheels/mlflow_export_import-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl`
